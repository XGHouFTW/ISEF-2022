# TODO use the tweepy library to collect current twitter data from twitter
# Twitter data is formatted as JSON objects, convert to DataFrame and save to CSV, 
# Only save the columns: text, date, userID, followerCount, retweets, likes, comments
# We will be using the Tweepy library because apparently nobody uses twython idk. 
# Most online tutorials covered tweepy so we'll just use it too. not much of a difference anyway

  # This part of the program will actually do the stuff, but any functions you need define above.
